### Project description:
The goal of this project was to create a virtual assistant services company with various pages. The challenge was to host this project and track the engagements of the website.

### Built with:
- [HTML]
- [CSS]

## Getting Started:
Follow the steps below to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### How to Install:
* Download the project files from the GitHub repository.
* Open the project folder.
* Simply launch the index.html file in your web browser.
* This project does not require any back-end setup, database, or installation tools

## Features and Functionality:
The web application consists of four main pages:

- **Home Page**

We assign a dedicated virtual assistant to your tasks.
You focus on your business while we handle the rest.

## Concept Process:

### Ideation:
The goal was to create a simple yet effective informational website with a focus on usability and aesthetics. The website promotes professional virtual assistant services in a clear, concise way. The primary challenge was to make the website visually engaging without using JavaScript or complex functionality.

## Development Process

### Implementation Process

HTML and CSS: The structure was built with semantic HTML, and CSS was used for styling and layout.
Responsive Design: CSS media queries were used to ensure the site looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Highlights:
Simple, engaging design: The visual layout encourages user engagement with call-to-action buttons.

### Challenges:
One major challenge was file corruption errors, as issues with hosting in Axxess, but they were solved with much help from their attentive hosting support team.

## Future Implementation:
In the future, I plan to add features such as adding basic JavaScript interactivity (e.g., form validation and FAQ accordion). Implement a CSS animation for the banner to enhance engagement. Explore SEO optimization techniques to increase site visibility.

## Final Outcome

### Website Link
http://cloudassistancevirtual.co.za


## Conclusion
This project has taught me a significant deal about axxess and over all website hosting.
